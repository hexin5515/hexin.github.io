I am a Ph.D in the School of Artificial Intelligence Jilin University, supervised by Professor [Xin Wang](https://xinwangjlu.github.io/). My current research focuses on fairness in recommender systems and robustness in graph neural networks. I aim to develop trustworthy recommendation algorithms and graph neural network architectures that remain reliable, fair, and stable when deployed in real-world, large-scale applications.
